Skeleton for initial Alpha model. Several ISA modules
still need to be replaced with Alpha versions.

- Build user-mode versions of m5 for Alpha as part of the configure/top level
  make step of hasim-alpha.
- Define a 5 stage model.  It is still basically the MIPS model, but it
  links with m5.  The model doesn't run yet, since m5 arguments aren't
  passed correctly.

Added skeleton Alpha ISA. It just tells the functional partition to execute
every instruction in software via emulation.

This isn't quite enough to run a benchmarks because it means branches cannot be
taken.
