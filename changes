- Build user-mode versions of m5 for Alpha as part of the configure/top level
  make step of hasim-alpha.
- Define a 5 stage model.  It is still basically the MIPS model, but it
  links with m5.  The model doesn't run yet, since m5 arguments aren't
  passed correctly.

Added skeleton Alpha ISA. It just tells the functional partition to execute
every instruction in software via emulation.

This isn't quite enough to run a benchmarks because it means branches cannot be
taken.

hasim-alpha ISA compiles. I changed the width of memory values to 32 bits temporarily to get going. This will change to 64 bit values soon.

The unpipelined and 5 stage models now use submodels for
the functional partition and common. The unpipelined model
did not and still does not compile.

Added svn:ignore properties for varous build outputs that
aren't checked in.

- Separate memory into two categories.  Functional model memory now is defined
  under the functional model.  The memory defined in the FPGA environment
  is now just scratchpad memory.  Either memory may be hybrid.
- Remove include file loop.

- LDAH was wrong because memDisp was a 16 bit type and left shift by 16
  was always 0.  Switch to memDisp as a Bit#(64) so the sign extend is done
  once.
- Add some more debugging output.
